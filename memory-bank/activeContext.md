## Current Work Focus

The primary focus has been on enhancing the API Keys management page. This involved adding a new "Tools" column to the API keys table, which displays a count of associated tools. Clicking this count opens a side drawer that lists all tools grouped by their respective projects.

## Recent Changes

- **Backend (`src/server/api/routers/apiKey.ts`):**
  - Modified the `getAll` tRPC procedure to include nested `_count` for tools within projects.
  - Added a new `getToolsByApiKeyId` tRPC procedure to fetch detailed tool information grouped by project.
- **Frontend (`src/app/(protected)/api-keys/page.tsx`):**
  - Updated the table header to "Tools".
  - Implemented the tool count display using a Shadcn `Badge` component with a `Wrench` icon, making it clickable to open the tool list drawer.
- **New Component (`src/app/(protected)/api-keys/_components/api-key-tools-drawer.tsx`):**
  - Created a new `Sheet`-based component to display tools grouped by project.
  - Ensured tool names are wrapped in the `Highlight` component.
  - Made the tool listing container scrollable.
  - Removed redundant close button.

## Next Steps

The current task of enhancing the API keys table with tool count and a detailed tool list drawer is complete.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- The decision to use nested `_count` in Prisma and a separate tRPC procedure for detailed data ensures efficient data fetching.
- The use of Shadcn UI's `Sheet` component provides a consistent and user-friendly experience for side drawers.
- Adherence to existing UI patterns (like the badge for counts) maintains application consistency.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- **Data Fetching:** Prioritize efficient data fetching by only loading detailed information when explicitly requested (lazy loading).
- **UI Consistency:** Maintain a consistent look and feel across the application by reusing Shadcn UI components and established styling patterns.
- **Component Design:** Create reusable and focused components for specific UI elements (e.g., `ApiKeyToolsDrawer`).

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Successfully implemented complex data aggregation and display across backend and frontend.
- Reinforced the importance of verifying component props to avoid TypeScript errors.
- Learned to effectively troubleshoot frontend rendering issues by inspecting data received from the backend.
