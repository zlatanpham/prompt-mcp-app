# Progress

## What Works

- The database schema has been updated to reflect the `Tool` model with the `name` field as unique and `tool_name` removed.
- The tRPC router for tools (`src/server/api/routers/tool.ts`) has been updated to interact with the new `Tool` model.
- The main project page (`src/app/(protected)/project/[projectId]/page.tsx`) correctly imports and uses the `Tool` component.
- The `Tool` component (`src/app/(protected)/project/[projectId]/_components/prompt.tsx`), `ManualToolDialog` (`src/app/(protected)/project/[projectId]/_components/manual-prompt-dialog.tsx`), and `ToolCard` (`src/app/(protected)/project/[projectId]/_components/prompt-card.tsx`) have all been updated to use the `Tool` model and reflect the new terminology.
- The `.clinerules` for self-improvement and coding standards have been updated to incorporate learnings from this task.

## What's Left to Build

- The TypeScript errors related to the Prisma client not recognizing the `Tool` model still exist because `pnpm db:generate` was skipped. This needs to be resolved by running the command.
- Full application functionality needs to be verified by the user.

## Current Status

All requested code changes have been implemented. The application is in a state where it should conceptually work with the "Tool" entity, but the TypeScript errors indicate a build-time issue that needs external resolution (running `pnpm db:generate`).

## Known Issues

- TypeScript errors: `Module '"@prisma/client"' has no exported member 'Tool'`. This prevents successful compilation and is due to the Prisma client not being regenerated.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initially, I planned to rename the component files (e.g., `prompt.tsx` to `tool.tsx`), but the user clarified that only content and imports should be updated, which was then followed.
- The conflict regarding `db:generate` commands highlighted a need for clearer `.clinerules` on how to handle such situations, leading to updates in the rules.
