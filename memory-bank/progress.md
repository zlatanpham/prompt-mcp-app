## What Works

- **API Keys Table Enhancement:**
  - The API keys table now includes a "Tools" column displaying the count of associated tools.
  - Clicking the tool count opens a side drawer (`Sheet`) that lists all tools, grouped by their respective projects.
  - Tool names within the drawer are highlighted using the `Highlight` component.
  - The tool list within the drawer is scrollable.
  - The tool count is displayed within a `Badge` component with a `Wrench` icon, consistent with the project card style.

## What's Left to Build

- All features requested for the API keys table and tool count display have been implemented and refined based on user feedback.

## Current Status

The task of adding a tool count column and a detailed tool list drawer to the API keys table is complete.

## Known Issues

- None related to this task.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initial decision to add a direct `tools` relation to `ApiKey` in Prisma was revised to a more appropriate approach of fetching nested counts and detailed tool data via tRPC procedures, ensuring correct data modeling and efficient data retrieval.
- The choice of Shadcn UI's `Drawer` was refined to `Sheet` for better side panel presentation, and further UI/UX improvements were made based on user feedback (highlighting tool names, scrollability, removing redundant buttons).
