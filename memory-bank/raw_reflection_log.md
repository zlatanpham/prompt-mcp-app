TaskRef: "Change copy icon to check icon on success in chat-message-display.tsx"

Learnings:
  - Successfully implemented a visual feedback mechanism for copy-to-clipboard functionality by switching icons instead of using toast notifications.
  - Utilized `useState` for managing the icon state and `setTimeout` for reverting the icon after a delay.

Difficulties:
  - No significant difficulties encountered. The task was straightforward.

Successes:
  - The icon switching functionality was implemented as requested, providing clear visual feedback to the user.
  - The `toast` dependency was successfully removed, simplifying the component.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - General pattern: Using icon changes with `useState` and `setTimeout` for transient visual feedback instead of toast notifications for simple actions.
