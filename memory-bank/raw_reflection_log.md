TaskRef: "Display 'Last edited {time_ago}' on project card, make project card clickable, change project description to textarea"

Learnings:
  - Successfully integrated `date-fns` `formatDistanceToNowStrict` to create a `timeAgo` utility function in `src/lib/utils.ts`.
  - Modified `src/app/(protected)/project/page.tsx` to use the `timeAgo` function for displaying the last edited time on project cards.
  - Implemented full card click navigation for project cards by wrapping the `Card` component with `Next/Link`.
  - Handled event propagation for `DropdownMenuTrigger` and `DropdownMenuItem` within the clickable project card to prevent navigation when interacting with action menus.
  - Replaced the `Input` component with `Textarea` for the project description field in the "Create new Project" dialog in `src/app/(protected)/project/page.tsx`.

Difficulties:
  - Initial error in `plan_mode_respond` due to incorrect XML formatting (missing `<response>` tag). Resolved by correcting the format.

Successes:
  - All requested UI/UX enhancements for project cards and the create project dialog were successfully implemented.
  - The `timeAgo` utility is reusable.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - General pattern: Using `e.stopPropagation()` for nested clickable elements to prevent parent click events.
  - General pattern: Creating reusable date formatting utilities (e.g., `timeAgo`).
  - UI/UX: Using `textarea` for multi-line text inputs.
