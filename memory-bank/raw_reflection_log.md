TaskRef: "Add last_used field to API Keys and implement recording process"

Learnings:

- Successfully added a new field (`last_used`) to a Prisma model (`ApiKey`) with `DateTime? @default(now()) @db.Timestamptz(6)`.
- Implemented a database update (`db.apiKey.update`) in an API route (`src/app/api/tools/route.ts`) to record the last usage timestamp (`data: { last_used: new Date() }`).
- Modified a React component (`src/app/(protected)/api-keys/page.tsx`) to display the new `last_used` field in a table, including a "Never" fallback for null values.
- Confirmed that Prisma's `findMany` automatically includes direct fields unless a `select` clause is explicitly specified at the top level.
- `pnpm db:generate` is crucial after schema changes to update Prisma client types and generate migrations. This command also applies the migration to the development database.
- `pnpm typecheck` can help resolve lingering TypeScript errors after schema and code changes by re-evaluating types.

Difficulties:

- Initially included `@map("lastUsed")` for the `last_used` field, which was incorrect as per `underscore_case` naming convention in `.clinerules/consolidated_learning.md`. Corrected by removing `@map`.
- Missed a `projectId` vs `project_id` typo in `src/app/api/tools/route.ts` during initial implementation, which caused a TypeScript error.
- Had to explicitly run `pnpm db:generate` and `pnpm typecheck` to resolve TypeScript errors after schema changes, which is a necessary step but was not explicitly planned for in the initial execution steps.

Successes:

- Successfully integrated a new database field from schema definition to UI display.
- Correctly implemented the logic for updating the `last_used` timestamp on API key usage.
- Successfully resolved all TypeScript errors and completed the task as per user requirements.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- Reinforce the `underscore_case` naming convention for Prisma fields and database columns.
- Emphasize the importance of running `pnpm db:generate` immediately after `prisma/schema.prisma` changes to update types and migrations.
- Note the common `projectId` vs `project_id` type of error when dealing with Prisma relations and mapped fields.
