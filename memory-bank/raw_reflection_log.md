TaskRef: "Improve UI/UX for tool argument creation"

Learnings:
- Successfully refactored `useFieldArray` hook and "Add Argument" button from child component (`ArgumentsFormArray`) to parent component (`ManualToolDialog`) to achieve desired UI alignment.
- Implemented visual "boxes" around each argument using `border rounded-md p-4 mb-4` for better visual grouping.
- Ensured all `FormLabel` components are always visible, improving clarity.
- Learned to interpret user feedback on UI layout more precisely: "break to single line for each input" meant vertical stacking of inputs (Name, Description, Type) within each argument box, rather than a horizontal grid. This required reverting from a `grid` layout to `space-y-4` for the inputs.
- Successfully resolved TypeScript errors related to type-only imports (`type FieldArrayWithId`, `type UseFieldArrayRemove`) and parsing errors caused by comments within template literals in JSX.

Difficulties:
- Initial misinterpretation of "single line for each input" led to a horizontal grid layout, which was not the user's intent. This was corrected after user feedback.
- Encountered TypeScript and ESLint errors after initial refactoring, which required careful attention to import types and removal of comments in JSX template literals.

Successes:
- Successfully implemented all user-requested UI/UX changes, including button placement, visual grouping, and input stacking.
- Demonstrated adaptability in re-interpreting and implementing user feedback.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- UI/UX interpretation: Clarify "single line" context (horizontal vs. vertical stacking of inputs).
- React Hook Form: Pattern for moving `useFieldArray` to parent for shared control.
- TypeScript: Best practice for `type` imports with `verbatimModuleSyntax`.

- Successfully identified and refactored AlertDialog usages in `src/app/(protected)/project/[projectId]/_components/tool.tsx` and `src/app/(protected)/project/page.tsx` to use the new `ConfirmActionDialog` component.
- The `ConfirmActionDialog` provides a consistent and reusable pattern for actions requiring user confirmation.
- The process involved:
  1. Identifying files with existing AlertDialog implementations for confirmation.
  2. Replacing AlertDialog imports with ConfirmActionDialog imports.
  3. Adapting state management (e.g., `isConfirmDeleteDialogOpen`, `projectToDelete`) to work with the new component's props (`isOpen`, `onOpenChange`, `onConfirm`).
  4. Mapping existing title, description, confirm, and cancel texts to the new component's props.

Difficulties:

- None encountered during the refactoring process. The existing AlertDialog structure was straightforward to adapt.

Successes:

- Achieved a more consistent UI/UX for confirmation actions across the application.
- Reduced code duplication by reusing a centralized component.
- Improved maintainability by abstracting the confirmation logic into a dedicated component.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: Centralized confirmation dialogs for consistent UI/UX and reduced code duplication.
- Specific refactoring steps for replacing AlertDialog with ConfirmActionDialog.

TaskRef: "Display 'Last edited {time_ago}' on project card, make project card clickable, change project description to textarea"

Learnings:

- Successfully integrated `date-fns` `formatDistanceToNowStrict` to create a `timeAgo` utility function in `src/lib/utils.ts`.
- Modified `src/app/(protected)/project/page.tsx` to use the `timeAgo` function for displaying the last edited time on project cards.
- Implemented full card click navigation for project cards by wrapping the `Card` component with `Next/Link`.
- Handled event propagation for `DropdownMenuTrigger` and `DropdownMenuItem` within the clickable project card to prevent navigation when interacting with action menus.
- Replaced the `Input` component with `Textarea` for the project description field in the "Create new Project" dialog in `src/app/(protected)/project/page.tsx`.

Difficulties:

- Initial error in `plan_mode_respond` due to incorrect XML formatting (missing `<response>` tag). Resolved by correcting the format.

Successes:

- All requested UI/UX enhancements for project cards and the create project dialog were successfully implemented.
- The `timeAgo` utility is reusable.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: Using `e.stopPropagation()` for nested clickable elements to prevent parent click events.
- General pattern: Creating reusable date formatting utilities (e.g., `timeAgo`).
- UI/UX: Using `textarea` for multi-line text inputs.

TaskRef: "Rename Prompt to Tool, update schema, routes, and components"

Learnings:

- Successfully renamed the `Prompt` model to `Tool` in `prisma/schema.prisma`, removed `tool_name`, and added `@unique` to `name`.
- Updated `src/server/api/routers/tool.ts` (previously `prompt.ts`) to reflect the `Tool` model and remove `tool_name` references.
- Updated `src/server/api/root.ts` to use `toolRouter`.
- Updated `src/app/(protected)/project/[projectId]/page.tsx` to import and use the `Tool` component.
- Updated `src/app/(protected)/project/[projectId]/_components/prompt.tsx` (now acting as `Tool` component) to reflect the `Tool` model, remove `tool_name` references, and update text.
- Updated `src/app/(protected)/project/[projectId]/_components/manual-prompt-dialog.tsx` to reflect the `Tool` model, remove `tool_name` references, and update text.
- Updated `src/app/(protected)/project/[projectId]/_components/prompt-card.tsx` to reflect the `Tool` model and update text.
- Encountered persistent TypeScript errors related to Prisma client not recognizing the `Tool` model, which were skipped as per user instruction. This highlights a potential conflict between user instructions and technical dependencies.
- Identified and proposed improvements to `.clinerules/self-improving-cline.md` and `.clinerules/1-coding.md` to address command interruption handling, database operation clarity, and prioritizing user instructions vs. technical requirements.

Difficulties:

- Repeated interruptions during `mv` commands and `pnpm db:generate`.
- Initial `pnpm db:generate` failure due to database drift, requiring `prisma migrate reset`.
- Conflict between user instruction to skip `db:generate` and the necessity of running it to resolve TypeScript errors.

Successes:

- Successfully applied all requested code changes across schema, router, and components.
- Identified and proposed valuable improvements to `.clinerules` for future interactions.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: Handling conflicts between user instructions and technical necessities.
- General pattern: Robustness for interrupted file operations (e.g., `mv`).
- Project-specific: Initial Prisma setup for new projects (reset and generate).

TaskRef: "Add args: jsonb to the Tool column"

Learnings:

- Successfully added `args: Json?` to the `Tool` model in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- Updated `create` and `update` tRPC procedures in `src/server/api/routers/tool.ts` to handle the new `args` field.
- Resolved TypeScript errors by running `pnpm db:generate` after schema modification and tRPC router updates.
- Encountered and resolved `replace_in_file` matching issues by falling back to `write_to_file` for schema modification.

Difficulties:

- `replace_in_file` failed twice due to exact match requirements, necessitating a fallback to `write_to_file`.

Successes:

- Successfully implemented the requested schema change and API updates.
- Successfully resolved the resulting TypeScript error.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: Handling `replace_in_file` failures by falling back to `write_to_file` for critical file modifications.
- Project-specific: Steps for adding new fields to Prisma models and updating tRPC.

Date: 2025-05-31
TaskRef: "Fix parsing error in src/app/(protected)/project/[projectId]/\_components/import-tools-dialog.tsx"

Learnings:

- Encountered a persistent `Parsing error: '...' expected.` in `import-tools-dialog.tsx` related to the `Textarea` component's `placeholder` prop.
- Attempts to fix by modifying the placeholder string content (from `...` to "some prompt content" to "example prompt"), moving the string to a variable, and explicitly listing `react-hook-form`'s `field` properties instead of using the spread operator `{field}` were unsuccessful.
- The error message remained consistent and misleading, suggesting the issue is not a code bug within the file but rather an environmental parsing problem (e.g., ESLint, TypeScript, or Babel/SWC configuration/version incompatibility).
- **New Learning (Functional Fix):** To update the UI after importing tools, it's necessary to invalidate the relevant tRPC query cache. The correct query to invalidate for tools by project ID was found to be `utils.tool.getByProjectId.invalidate()`.
- **New Learning (Typo Fix):** When invalidating tRPC queries with parameters, the property names in the invalidation object must exactly match the input schema of the tRPC procedure (e.g., `project_id` instead of `projectId`).

Difficulties:

- The cryptic and persistent nature of the parsing error made it difficult to diagnose and resolve through direct code modifications. The error message did not accurately reflect the actual syntax issue, leading to multiple failed attempts at fixing the string literal.
- Initially assumed an incorrect tRPC query name (`getTools` instead of `getByProjectId`) and an incorrect parameter name (`projectId` instead of `project_id`), requiring further investigation of the tRPC router definition.

Successes:

- Systematically ruled out common causes for JSX parsing errors related to string literals and prop spreading.
- Identified that the root cause of the parsing error is likely external to the file's content, residing in the project's tooling configuration.
- Successfully identified and implemented the tRPC query invalidation logic to refresh the tool list after import.
- Corrected the tRPC query name and parameter name for invalidation based on the router definition.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: Troubleshooting persistent and misleading parsing errors in JSX/TSX.
- Specific action: When code appears syntactically correct but parsing errors persist, investigate ESLint, TypeScript, or Babel/SWC configurations.
- General pattern: Invalidating tRPC queries after mutations for UI updates.
- Specific action: Always verify exact tRPC query names and input schema property names from router definitions when invalidating queries.

TaskRef: "Implement shared layout container and refine API Keys loading state"

Learnings:

- Successfully implemented `DashboardLayout` as a shared layout component for protected pages (`/`, `/project`, `/api-keys`).
- Refactored `src/app/(protected)/page.tsx` and `src/app/(protected)/api-keys/page.tsx` to use `DashboardLayout`.
- Implemented granular loading state with skeleton UI for the API Keys table, ensuring the main layout remains visible during data fetching.
- Learned the importance of precise `SEARCH` blocks in `replace_in_file` and the utility of `write_to_file` as a fallback for complex or error-prone modifications.
- Identified a typo in an import statement (`Button } =>` instead of `Button } from`) during the process, which was corrected.

Difficulties:

- Initial `replace_in_file` attempts for `src/app/(protected)/api-keys/page.tsx` resulted in parsing errors and duplicated code due to incorrect `SEARCH` block matching.
- This required using `write_to_file` as a more robust solution to overwrite the file with the correct content.
- A subsequent typo in an import statement (`Button } =>`) caused further parsing errors, which was then fixed.

Successes:

- Achieved consistent layout across protected pages.
- Improved user experience by implementing a partial loading state with skeleton UI for the API Keys page.
- Successfully recovered from `replace_in_file` errors by using `write_to_file` and precise typo correction.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: Use of shared layout components for UI consistency.
- General pattern: Implementing granular loading states with skeleton UIs.
- Process improvement: When `replace_in_file` fails repeatedly due to complex changes or unexpected file states, consider `write_to_file` as a reliable fallback.
- Coding standard: Emphasize correct import syntax.

TaskRef: "Fixing long text in tool table description"

Learnings:

- Successfully implemented text truncation to two lines using Tailwind CSS `line-clamp-2` and `overflow-hidden` classes.
- Applied fixed width to table columns using `w-[400px]` Tailwind class to control layout.
- Confirmed that `replace_in_file` can be used for adding class names to existing HTML/JSX elements.

Difficulties:

- Initial plan to use tooltips was rejected by the user, requiring a pivot to line clamping and fixed column widths. This highlights the importance of user feedback in refining solutions.

Successes:

- The revised solution directly addressed the user's preference and the visual issue effectively.
- The use of `replace_in_file` was precise and efficient for the required changes.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: Handling long text in tables using `line-clamp` and fixed column widths for better UI control.
- User preference: Prioritize direct visual truncation over tooltips when explicitly requested.
