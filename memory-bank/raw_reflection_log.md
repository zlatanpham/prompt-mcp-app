TaskRef: "Fixing long text in tool table description"

Learnings:
  - Successfully implemented text truncation to two lines using Tailwind CSS `line-clamp-2` and `overflow-hidden` classes.
  - Applied fixed width to table columns using `w-[400px]` Tailwind class to control layout.
  - Confirmed that `replace_in_file` can be used for adding class names to existing HTML/JSX elements.

Difficulties:
  - Initial plan to use tooltips was rejected by the user, requiring a pivot to line clamping and fixed column widths. This highlights the importance of user feedback in refining solutions.

Successes:
  - The revised solution directly addressed the user's preference and the visual issue effectively.
  - The use of `replace_in_file` was precise and efficient for the required changes.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - General pattern: Handling long text in tables using `line-clamp` and fixed column widths for better UI control.
  - User preference: Prioritize direct visual truncation over tooltips when explicitly requested.

TaskRef: "Add confirmation before API key regeneration and refactor confirmation dialog"

Learnings:

- Implemented a generic confirmation dialog component (`ConfirmActionDialog`) for reusable confirmation flows.
- Refactored component location from a feature-specific `_components` directory to a shared `src/components` directory based on user feedback, emphasizing the importance of component reusability and proper organization.
- Applied confirmation step for sensitive actions (API key regeneration) to improve user experience and prevent accidental operations.

Difficulties:

- Encountered issues with `replace_in_file` due to auto-formatting changing import paths, requiring careful adjustment of SEARCH blocks and iterative application of changes. This highlights the need for precise matching and adapting to formatter behavior.

Successes:

- Successfully moved and refactored a component to a more appropriate shared location.
- Successfully implemented a user-requested confirmation step for a sensitive action.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: Creating generic, reusable UI components (e.g., confirmation dialogs).
- Component organization: Best practice to move generic components to a shared `src/components` directory.
- Workflow: Handling auto-formatting during `replace_in_file` operations by re-reading file content or using smaller, more precise SEARCH blocks.
- User experience: Implementing confirmation steps for destructive or sensitive actions.
