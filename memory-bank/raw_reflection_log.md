TaskRef: "Customize Skeleton to resemble NavUser component"

Learnings:
  - Successfully replicated the visual structure of a complex React component (`NavUser`) using `Skeleton` components and Tailwind CSS utility classes.
  - The process involved analyzing the target component's layout (avatar, text blocks, icon) and translating those visual elements into corresponding `Skeleton` components with appropriate sizing and spacing classes.
  - Specifically, used `h-8 w-8 rounded-lg` for avatar, `h-4 w-24` and `h-3 w-32` for text lines, and `h-4 w-4` for icons, combined with `flex`, `items-center`, `gap-2`, `px-1`, `py-1.5`, `grid`, `flex-1`, `text-left`, `text-sm`, `leading-tight`, and `ml-auto` for layout.

Difficulties:
  - No significant difficulties encountered. The task was straightforward once the `NavUser` component's structure was understood.

Successes:
  - The `Skeleton` component now accurately mimics the `NavUser` component's appearance, providing a better loading state experience.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - General pattern: Replicating component loading states with `Skeleton` by mapping visual elements to `Skeleton` components and applying corresponding layout/sizing classes.
