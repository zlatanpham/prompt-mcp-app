TaskRef: "Fix streaming error in src/app/api/chat/route.ts"

Learnings:
  - The `ai` SDK's `streamText` function, when used with `toTextStreamResponse()`, produces a plain text stream without SSE (Server-Sent Events) delimiters.
  - Client-side errors like "Failed to parse stream string. No separator found." often indicate that the client is expecting an SSE-formatted stream.
  - Using `result.toDataStreamResponse()` with the `ai` SDK correctly formats the stream as SSE, including `data:` prefixes and `\n\n` separators, which resolves client-side parsing issues for SSE consumers.

Difficulties:
  - Initial diagnosis required understanding the difference between `toTextStreamResponse()` and `toDataStreamResponse()` and their implications for client-side parsing.

Successes:
  - Successfully identified the root cause of the streaming error.
  - Applied the correct fix by switching to `toDataStreamResponse()`.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - General pattern: When using `@ai-sdk/google` or similar AI SDKs for streaming, if the client expects SSE, use `toDataStreamResponse()` instead of `toTextStreamResponse()`.
