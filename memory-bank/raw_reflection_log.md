TaskRef: "Enhance Project List UI with Tool Count"

Learnings:
  - Successfully updated tRPC `project.getAll` procedure to include `_count` of related `Tool` models using Prisma's `include` and `_count` aggregation.
  - Implemented UI enhancements in `src/app/(protected)/project/page.tsx` to display the tool count.
  - Adhered to Shadcn UI standards by using the `Badge` component and `Wrench` icon from `lucide-react`.
  - Improved project card visual appeal with Tailwind CSS classes for layout, typography, and hover effects.

Difficulties:
  - None encountered. The process was straightforward given the existing project structure and Shadcn UI components.

Successes:
  - Successfully integrated backend data (tool count) with frontend UI.
  - Enhanced user experience by providing more essential information on the project list page.
  - Maintained consistency with Shadcn UI design principles.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - General pattern: Using Prisma `_count` for related model aggregation in tRPC queries.
  - UI pattern: Displaying counts of related entities using Shadcn `Badge` and `lucide-react` icons for enhanced user engagement.
