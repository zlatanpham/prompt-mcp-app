TaskRef: "Implement 'Move Tools' function for project detail page"

Learnings:

- Successfully implemented a tRPC mutation (`tool.moveTools`) to transfer tools between projects by updating their `projectId`.
- Learned to filter projects in the UI to exclude the current project when selecting a target for tool movement.
- Gained experience in creating a complex Shadcn UI dialog with `react-hook-form`, `zod` validation, and dynamic data fetching (tools and projects).
- Confirmed the process for adding new Shadcn UI components (`pnpm ui:add [component]`) and handling their integration.
- Reinforced the importance of using `useQueryClient().invalidateQueries` for proper cache invalidation after data mutations in tRPC/React Query, specifically for `getByProjectId` queries for both source and target projects.
- Understood the need to use `void` operator for unawaited promises from `queryClient.invalidateQueries` to satisfy ESLint rules.

Difficulties:

- Initial TypeScript errors due to missing `ScrollArea` component, resolved by adding it via Shadcn CLI.
- ESLint errors regarding unawaited promises from `queryClient.invalidateQueries`, resolved by explicitly using the `void` operator.

Successes:

- Successfully implemented the end-to-end "move tools" feature, including backend mutation, frontend dialog, and UI integration.
- All identified errors (TypeScript and ESLint) were resolved efficiently.
- The solution adheres to the T3 stack principles and uses existing patterns (tRPC, Shadcn UI, React Hook Form, Zod).

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: Handling tRPC query invalidation for multiple related queries after a mutation.
- General pattern: Integrating new Shadcn UI components and resolving associated import/type issues.
- Specific: `tool.moveTools` mutation logic for secure tool transfer.
