TaskRef: "Add slide-down animation to collapsible block in chat-message-display.tsx"

Learnings:

- Successfully integrated `framer-motion` to create a slide-down animation for a `Collapsible` component.
- Used `motion.div` with `initial={{ opacity: 0, height: 0 }}`, `animate={{ opacity: 1, height: "auto" }}`, and `exit={{ opacity: 0, height: 0 }}` for the animation.
- Set `transition={{ duration: 0.3, ease: "easeInOut" }}` for a smooth effect.
- Added `className="overflow-hidden"` to the `motion.div` to prevent content from overflowing during the height animation.

Difficulties:

- None encountered. The task was straightforward.

Successes:

- The animation was implemented as requested, providing a smoother user experience.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: Using `framer-motion` for slide-down/up animations with `height: "auto"` and `overflow-hidden`.
