TaskRef: "Implement model selection and generic API key handling"

Learnings:

- Successfully integrated a model selection dropdown in `src/app/(protected)/page.tsx` using Shadcn UI's `Select` component.
- Implemented dynamic model and provider selection in `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` based on the `provider/model-code` convention.
- Handled provider-specific model string formatting (e.g., prepending `models/` for Google models).
- Managed multiple API keys in `localStorage` and passed them as an object to the backend.

Difficulties:

- **Persistent TypeScript Error in `src/app/(protected)/page.tsx`**: The error `Argument of type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'. Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.` for `apiKey` in `useChat` hook's `body` remained unresolved. This suggests an extremely strict type definition in `@ai-sdk/react` that does not accept `undefined`, `null`, or even an empty string (`""`) if the original value was `undefined`. This is a limitation of the `ai-sdk`'s types that cannot be resolved without modifying the library or fundamentally changing the application's architecture (e.g., conditionally rendering the `useChat` hook, which is against React rules).
- **AI SDK Model ID Typing**: The model ID types (`GoogleGenerativeAIModelId`, `DeepSeekChatModelId`) are not exported, requiring `as any` assertions in `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` to satisfy TypeScript, leading to ESLint warnings about unsafe `any` usage.

Successes:

- The application now supports selecting between DeepSeek and Google models.
- The API key dialog is generic and handles multiple providers.
- The backend dynamically routes requests to the correct AI provider.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: When dealing with strict third-party library types (especially for required parameters that might be optional in practice), investigate if the library offers a more flexible API or if type declarations can be augmented. If not, document the limitation and consider `as any` as a last resort, or explore alternative libraries/approaches.
- Specific to `@ai-sdk/react`: The `useChat` hook's `apiKey` parameter might require a non-empty string, which can be problematic for optional API keys. This needs further investigation or a feature request to the library maintainers.
