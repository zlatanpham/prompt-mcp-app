TaskRef: "Update tool.name validation for API and frontend"

Learnings:

- Successfully updated regex for tool names to enforce "words joined by underscores" pattern.
- The `src/lib/validators/tool.ts` file is a centralized location for validation schemas, impacting both frontend and backend (tRPC) validation.
- The regex `^[a-z0-9]+(?:_[a-z0-9]+)*$` effectively validates names like `do_an_action` while disallowing `____` or `_hello___hello`.

Difficulties:

- Initial error in `plan_mode_respond` due to missing `<response>` tag, quickly resolved by re-issuing the command with correct formatting.

Successes:

- Successfully applied the regex update to the shared validation file.
- Ensured the new validation message is clear and informative.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: Centralized validation schemas (e.g., Zod) are effective for consistent validation across layers.
- Regex for underscore-separated words: `^[a-z0-9]+(?:_[a-z0-9]+)*$`
