TaskRef: "Update dropdown menu style in API Keys page"

Learnings:
  - Successfully integrated Lucide icons (`Pencil`, `RefreshCw`, `Trash2`) into Shadcn UI `DropdownMenuItem` components.
  - Applied Tailwind CSS classes (`text-red-600`, `focus:text-red-600`) to `DropdownMenuItem` for specific styling (e.g., red text for delete action).
  - Confirmed the process of adding icons to Shadcn UI components involves importing the icon and placing it directly within the component's children, often with a margin utility class (`mr-2`) for spacing.

Difficulties:
  - None encountered. The task was straightforward.

Successes:
  - The dropdown menu now visually matches the provided image, enhancing the UI/UX.
  - The changes were implemented efficiently and accurately using `replace_in_file`.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - General pattern: Adding icons and specific styling to Shadcn UI dropdown menu items.
