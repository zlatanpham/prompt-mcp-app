TaskRef: "Fixing long text in tool table description"

Learnings:
  - Successfully implemented text truncation to two lines using Tailwind CSS `line-clamp-2` and `overflow-hidden` classes.
  - Applied fixed width to table columns using `w-[400px]` Tailwind class to control layout.
  - Confirmed that `replace_in_file` can be used for adding class names to existing HTML/JSX elements.

Difficulties:
  - Initial plan to use tooltips was rejected by the user, requiring a pivot to line clamping and fixed column widths. This highlights the importance of user feedback in refining solutions.

Successes:
  - The revised solution directly addressed the user's preference and the visual issue effectively.
  - The use of `replace_in_file` was precise and efficient for the required changes.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - General pattern: Handling long text in tables using `line-clamp` and fixed column widths for better UI control.
  - User preference: Prioritize direct visual truncation over tooltips when explicitly requested.
