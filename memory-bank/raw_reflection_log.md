TaskRef: "Implement shared layout container and refine API Keys loading state"

Learnings:
  - Successfully implemented `DashboardLayout` as a shared layout component for protected pages (`/`, `/project`, `/api-keys`).
  - Refactored `src/app/(protected)/page.tsx` and `src/app/(protected)/api-keys/page.tsx` to use `DashboardLayout`.
  - Implemented granular loading state with skeleton UI for the API Keys table, ensuring the main layout remains visible during data fetching.
  - Learned the importance of precise `SEARCH` blocks in `replace_in_file` and the utility of `write_to_file` as a fallback for complex or error-prone modifications.
  - Identified a typo in an import statement (`Button } =>` instead of `Button } from`) during the process, which was corrected.

Difficulties:
  - Initial `replace_in_file` attempts for `src/app/(protected)/api-keys/page.tsx` resulted in parsing errors and duplicated code due to incorrect `SEARCH` block matching.
  - This required using `write_to_file` as a more robust solution to overwrite the file with the correct content.
  - A subsequent typo in an import statement (`Button } =>`) caused further parsing errors, which was then fixed.

Successes:
  - Achieved consistent layout across protected pages.
  - Improved user experience by implementing a partial loading state with skeleton UI for the API Keys page.
  - Successfully recovered from `replace_in_file` errors by using `write_to_file` and precise typo correction.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - General pattern: Use of shared layout components for UI consistency.
  - General pattern: Implementing granular loading states with skeleton UIs.
  - Process improvement: When `replace_in_file` fails repeatedly due to complex changes or unexpected file states, consider `write_to_file` as a reliable fallback.
  - Coding standard: Emphasize correct import syntax.
