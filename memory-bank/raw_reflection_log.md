TaskRef: "Refactor confirmation dialogs to reuse ConfirmActionDialog component"

Learnings:
  - Successfully identified and refactored AlertDialog usages in `src/app/(protected)/project/[projectId]/_components/tool.tsx` and `src/app/(protected)/project/page.tsx` to use the new `ConfirmActionDialog` component.
  - The `ConfirmActionDialog` provides a consistent and reusable pattern for actions requiring user confirmation.
  - The process involved:
      1. Identifying files with existing AlertDialog implementations for confirmation.
      2. Replacing AlertDialog imports with ConfirmActionDialog imports.
      3. Adapting state management (e.g., `isConfirmDeleteDialogOpen`, `projectToDelete`) to work with the new component's props (`isOpen`, `onOpenChange`, `onConfirm`).
      4. Mapping existing title, description, confirm, and cancel texts to the new component's props.

Difficulties:
  - None encountered during the refactoring process. The existing AlertDialog structure was straightforward to adapt.

Successes:
  - Achieved a more consistent UI/UX for confirmation actions across the application.
  - Reduced code duplication by reusing a centralized component.
  - Improved maintainability by abstracting the confirmation logic into a dedicated component.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - General pattern: Centralized confirmation dialogs for consistent UI/UX and reduced code duplication.
  - Specific refactoring steps for replacing AlertDialog with ConfirmActionDialog.
