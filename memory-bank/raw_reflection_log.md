TaskRef: "Refactor reset-password and forgot-password pages to match login/signup UI"

Learnings:
  - Successfully refactored `src/app/(public)/reset-password/page.tsx` and `src/app/(public)/forgot-password/page.tsx` to align with the Shadcn UI `Card` and `Form` component structure used in `login` and `signup` pages.
  - Implemented `react-hook-form` and `zod` for form validation in both pages, replacing manual state management and validation logic.
  - Consolidated message display to use `sonner` toasts exclusively, removing redundant `message` state and `p` tags.
  - Adjusted overall page layout to use `flex flex-col gap-6` for consistency with other public authentication pages.

Difficulties:
  - Ensuring all imports and component usages were correctly updated to reflect the new form and UI structure.
  - Adapting existing mutation calls to work with `react-hook-form`'s `onSubmit` data structure.

Successes:
  - Achieved consistent UI/UX across all public authentication pages (`login`, `signup`, `forgot-password`, `reset-password`).
  - Improved code maintainability and adherence to T3 stack best practices by using `react-hook-form` and `zod` for form handling.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - General pattern: Standardize authentication-related forms across the application using Shadcn UI Card components, `react-hook-form`, and `zod` for validation.
