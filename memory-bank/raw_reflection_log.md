TaskRef: "Add tool count column and tool list drawer to API keys table"

Learnings:
  - Successfully modified tRPC `apiKey` router to include nested `_count` for tools within projects for `getAll` procedure.
  - Implemented a new tRPC procedure `getToolsByApiKeyId` to fetch tools grouped by project for a given API key. This involved querying `Project`s related to the `ApiKey` and including their `Tool`s.
  - Created a new React component `ApiKeyToolsDrawer` using Shadcn UI's `Sheet` to display the grouped tools on the right side of the window.
  - Integrated the new drawer component and the tool count display into `src/app/(protected)/api-keys/page.tsx`, making the count clickable to open the drawer.
  - Learned how to sum nested counts from Prisma query results in the frontend.
  - Corrected the usage of `Highlight` component to pass content as `children` instead of a `text` prop.
  - Implemented scrollability for the tool listing container within the drawer.
  - Removed the redundant close button from the drawer footer.
  - Updated the "Tool Count" column label to "Tools" and wrapped the count in a Shadcn `Badge` component with a `Wrench` icon, matching the style of project cards.

Difficulties:
  - Initially considered adding a direct `tools` relation to `ApiKey` in `prisma/schema.prisma`, but realized it was incorrect due to the many-to-many relationship between `ApiKey` and `Project`, and one-to-many between `Project` and `Tool`. The correct approach was to handle the aggregation and fetching logic in the tRPC router.
  - Encountered a TypeScript error when using the `Highlight` component due to incorrect prop usage, which was resolved by checking the component's expected props.
  - Faced a temporary rendering issue where the drawer only showed one project's tools, which was resolved by confirming the backend data structure and frontend rendering logic.

Successes:
  - The implementation followed the planned architecture, ensuring efficient data fetching (tool count with `getAll`, detailed tools on demand).
  - The UI integration is seamless with existing Shadcn components and now adheres to user's specific layout and styling requests, including the badge and icon for the tool count.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - Pattern: Handling nested counts and aggregations in tRPC/Prisma for complex relationships.
  - Pattern: Lazy loading detailed data (drawer content) only when needed.
  - UI/UX: Best practices for drawer/sheet components (placement, scrollability, button redundancy).
  - Component Usage: Always verify component props by reading the component's definition file.
  - Consistency: Applying consistent UI patterns (e.g., badge for counts) across different parts of the application.

TaskRef: "Export all tools from all projects in JSON format on account page"

Learnings:

- Successfully added a new tRPC endpoint `getAllByUserId` to `src/server/api/routers/tool.ts` to fetch all tools for a user across all projects. This involved correctly querying `db.project` by `created_by_user_id`.
- Implemented a simplified export functionality on the account page (`src/app/(protected)/account/page.tsx`) that uses a confirmation alert instead of a multi-step dialog with checkboxes.
- Converted `src/app/(protected)/account/page.tsx` to a Client Component to enable client-side state management and session fetching using `useSession`.
- Enhanced the `useConfirmAction` hook in `src/components/confirm-action-dialog.tsx` to return a Promise, allowing for `await`ing user confirmation. This is a reusable pattern for confirmation dialogs.
- Addressed various TypeScript and ESLint errors related to `await`ing non-Promises, nullish coalescing, and incorrect component usage.

Difficulties:

- Initial `replace_in_file` attempts failed due to inexact `SEARCH` block matches, especially after file content reverted due to previous interruptions. This highlighted the importance of using the exact `file_content` from the error message for subsequent `SEARCH` blocks or resorting to `write_to_file` for larger changes.
- Understanding the correct Prisma query for projects by user (`created_by_user_id` instead of `user_id`).
- Adapting a Server Component to a Client Component and managing session fetching and dialog state.

Successes:

- Successfully implemented the requested feature with the simplified UI.
- Correctly integrated tRPC query, UI components, and client-side logic.
- Improved the `useConfirmAction` hook, making it more versatile.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- Pattern: Using `write_to_file` as a fallback for complex `replace_in_file` operations or when `SEARCH` block matching becomes problematic due to file reverts/auto-formatting.
- Pattern: Implementing client-side session fetching and state management for pages that need interactive UI elements in Next.js App Router.
- Pattern: Enhancing generic UI hooks (like `useConfirmAction`) to return Promises for better asynchronous flow control.
- Prisma: Correctly identifying and using foreign key relationships (e.g., `created_by_user_id` for `Project` model).
