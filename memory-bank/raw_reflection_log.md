TaskRef: "Convert ToolSelectorDropdown to use Popover"

Learnings:

- Successfully migrated a component from Shadcn UI's `DropdownMenu` to `Popover`.
- Key changes involved:
    - Replacing `DropdownMenu`, `DropdownMenuTrigger`, `DropdownMenuContent` with `Popover`, `PopoverTrigger`, `PopoverContent`.
    - Replacing `DropdownMenuItem` with custom `div` elements. This required manually applying Tailwind CSS classes to replicate the `DropdownMenuItem`'s default styling (e.g., `relative flex cursor-default select-none items-center rounded-sm px-4 py-1.5 text-sm outline-none transition-colors hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground data-[disabled]:pointer-events-none data-[disabled]:opacity-50`).
    - Replacing `DropdownMenuLabel` with a `div` with similar styling (`px-4 py-2 text-sm font-semibold`).
    - Replacing `DropdownMenuSeparator` with a `div` with `h-px bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700` for a visual separator.
    - Adjusting `PopoverContent` to have `p-0` to remove default padding and allow custom padding on inner elements.
    - Removing `onSelect={(e) => e.preventDefault()}` from the `div` elements, as it was specific to `DropdownMenuItem`.
    - Ensuring `Switch` components within the custom `div` items have `ml-auto` for proper alignment.

Difficulties:

- Replicating the exact styling and behavior of `DropdownMenuItem` with generic `div` elements required careful application of multiple Tailwind CSS classes to match Shadcn UI's default component styling. This is a common challenge when moving from highly opinionated components to more flexible ones.

Successes:

- The conversion was successful, maintaining the visual appearance and functionality of the component.
- The use of `Popover` provides more flexibility for future UI enhancements compared to `DropdownMenu`.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: When converting between similar Shadcn UI components (e.g., DropdownMenu to Popover), be prepared to manually replicate styling for inner elements (like menu items, labels, separators) using Tailwind CSS if direct replacements are not available.
- Specific styling for Shadcn-like menu items: `relative flex cursor-default select-none items-center rounded-sm px-4 py-1.5 text-sm outline-none transition-colors hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground data-[disabled]:pointer-events-none data-[disabled]:opacity-50`.
