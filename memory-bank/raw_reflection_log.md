TaskRef: "Enhance Project List UI with Tool Count"

Learnings:
  - Successfully updated tRPC `project.getAll` procedure to include `_count` of related `Tool` models using Prisma's `include` and `_count` aggregation.
  - Implemented UI enhancements in `src/app/(protected)/project/page.tsx` to display the tool count.
  - Adhered to Shadcn UI standards by using the `Badge` component and `Wrench` icon from `lucide-react`.
  - Improved project card visual appeal with Tailwind CSS classes for layout, typography, and hover effects.

Difficulties:
  - None encountered. The process was straightforward given the existing project structure and Shadcn UI components.

Successes:
  - Successfully integrated backend data (tool count) with frontend UI.
  - Enhanced user experience by providing more essential information on the project list page.
  - Maintained consistency with Shadcn UI design principles.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - General pattern: Using Prisma `_count` for related model aggregation in tRPC queries.
  - UI pattern: Displaying counts of related entities using Shadcn `Badge` and `lucide-react` icons for enhanced user engagement.

TaskRef: "Implement Skeleton UI for Project Detail Page Loading State"

Learnings:

- Successfully replaced text-based loading indicator with Shadcn UI's `Skeleton` component in `src/app/(protected)/project/[projectId]/page.tsx`.
- Applied Tailwind CSS utility classes to `Skeleton` components to mimic the layout of the project detail page (e.g., title, buttons, main content area).
- Ensured a better user experience by providing a visual representation of content loading.

Difficulties:

- None encountered. The process was straightforward.

Successes:

- Improved the aesthetic and user experience of the project detail page during loading.
- Maintained consistency with Shadcn UI design principles.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- UI pattern: Using Shadcn `Skeleton` component for improved loading state visuals, especially for pages with distinct layouts.

TaskRef: "Fix Breadcrumb Loading State Type Error and Implement Skeleton"

Learnings:

- Resolved TypeScript error "Type 'string | Element' is not assignable to type 'string'" by updating `label` property in `BreadcrumbItem` interface within `src/components/dashboard-layout.tsx` to `React.ReactNode`.
- Successfully implemented `Skeleton` component in the breadcrumb of `src/app/(protected)/project/[projectId]/page.tsx` to display a visual loading state instead of "..." text.
- This ensures consistency in loading UI across the project detail page.

Difficulties:

- Encountered a TypeScript type mismatch when trying to render a React element (`Skeleton`) in a prop expecting a `string`. This required modifying the component's interface.

Successes:

- Successfully fixed the type error and implemented the desired UI enhancement.
- Maintained type safety while improving user experience.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: When a component prop expects a `string` but needs to render a `React.ReactNode` (e.g., a component or element), update the prop's type definition to `React.ReactNode`.
- UI pattern: Consistent use of `Skeleton` components for all loading states, including smaller elements like breadcrumbs, to provide a cohesive user experience.
