TaskRef: "Make ApiKeyDialog generic for multiple providers and fix related type errors"

Learnings:
  - Successfully refactored `ApiKeyDialog` to accept and manage API keys for multiple providers (Google, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Anthropic) using a `Record<string, string>` state.
  - Implemented loading and saving of multiple API keys to `localStorage` based on provider-specific storage keys.
  - Updated dialog title, description, and input fields to be generic.
  - Updated `src/app/(protected)/page.tsx` to manage `apiKeys` as a `Record<string, string>` and pass it to `ApiKeyDialog`.

Difficulties:
  - Encountered a persistent TypeScript error (`Argument of type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'. Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.`) on the `apiKey` property within the `useChat` hook's `body` in `src/app/(protected)/page.tsx`.
  - This error persisted despite:
      - Initializing `apiKeys` state with `localStorage.getItem(...) ?? ""` to ensure `apiKeys.google` is always a `string` (either stored value or empty string).
      - Explicitly casting `apiKeys.google as string`.
      - Using the non-null assertion `apiKeys.google!`.
  - This suggests that the `useChat` hook from `@ai-sdk/react` has a very strict type definition for `body.apiKey` that likely requires a *non-empty* string, and does not accept `undefined`, `null`, or even `""` if the original value was `undefined`.
  - Since React Hooks must be called unconditionally, it's not possible to conditionally pass the `apiKey` to `useChat` only when it's a non-empty string.

Successes:
  - The `ApiKeyDialog` is now generic and handles multiple API keys as requested.
  - The `page.tsx` component correctly manages and passes these keys to the dialog.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - General pattern: When integrating with third-party hooks (like `useChat` from `@ai-sdk/react`) that have strict type requirements for optional parameters (e.g., requiring a non-empty string), investigate if the library provides a way to conditionally enable/disable features or if the type definition needs to be relaxed/extended. If not, a workaround might involve ensuring the required value is always present (e.g., by disabling UI elements that trigger the hook until the value is provided) or by forking/extending the library's types.
